Evolving Neural Network ABM
1/24/24 - Started Project
1/25/24 - Evolution works pretty well. Still need to implement Pheramones, Population density and Genetic similarity
          Want to start timing my runs
          Eventually optimize - How should neural network be set up for faster times
          Add Kill feature
          LastMove sensor doesn't know if move failed
          
 1/29/14 - Add better collision detection. Runs in n^2 time but there should be a way to map agents -> indices and then only check surrounding blocks
           Possily add ray tracing and predator-prey relations
           Number of total edges changes size every loop. Look at how genes are created and evolved.
           Weird behavior with unequal x-y dimensions
           
           
           
           
TODO:    
x Distance to barrier
y distance to barrier
LastMove sensor doesn't know if move failed
Weird behavior with unequal x-y dimensions
genome similarity / color (semi-done)
Look into arctan function



Future Additions:
