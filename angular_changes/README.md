Agent based model of an evolving Neural Network. 
Git last updated Feb 8th. 
If you want to run, look at Simulation and InitializationVariables.
  The 'harder' the environment, the more time per run and loops you should set.
  The current environment reaches an equilibrium ~35% survival after ~75 runs of ~100 runs. 
  This can take upwards of 45 min to run. Sorry.
Additionally, look in environment to change Barriers and Survival zones.
